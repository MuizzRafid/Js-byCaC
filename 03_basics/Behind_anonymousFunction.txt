function callback(n) {
  return n + 1;
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

function PleaseCalculate(arr, callback) {
  const result = [];
  arr.forEach((e) => {
    result.push(callback(e));
  });
  result.forEach((e) => {
    console.log(e);
  });
  console.log("end");
}

PleaseCalculate(arr, callback);

PleaseCalculate(arr, (n) => {
  return n + 2;
});



//           who does it works behind

How It Works Behind the Scenes:
1. Definition and Passing the Function:
When you call PleaseCalculate like this, an anonymous function is created at the moment the code is 
executed. This function has no name, but it’s still a first-class object in JavaScript (functions in 
JavaScript are objects). You can pass this object around, just like any other object or variable.

The anonymous function (n) => { return n + 2; } is passed to PleaseCalculate and assigned to the callback
 parameter of the function.

2. Anonymous Function in Memory:
Even though it has no name, the anonymous function is still stored in memory. The JavaScript engine 
allocates memory for the function object and links it to the callback parameter inside PleaseCalculate.

In simple terms: An anonymous function is like an unnamed object in memory that is assigned to callback.
 It doesn’t need a name to function, it just exists in memory for as long as it is needed.
3. Calling the Anonymous Function:
Now,within PleaseCalculate, you are using the callback function on each element of the array.Specifically,
 this line in PleaseCalculate:

javascript
Copy code
result.push(callback(e)); // This calls the anonymous function
Since callback refers to the anonymous function, JavaScript evaluates callback(e) by passing each 
element (e) from arr into the anonymous function.

So for each element in arr, the function n => n + 2 is called:

For 1, the callback does 1 + 2 = 3
For 2, the callback does 2 + 2 = 4
And so on...
4. After the Call:
Once the PleaseCalculate function finishes its execution, the anonymous function is no longer needed, 
so it is eventually garbage collected. In other words, the memory used by the anonymous function is 
released because nothing else is referencing it.

Step-by-Step Walkthrough:
Let’s look at what happens step-by-step in this example:

You call PleaseCalculate(arr, (n) => { return n + 2; });

A new anonymous function (n) => { return n + 2; } is created and stored in memory.
The reference to this function is passed as the callback parameter in PleaseCalculate.
Inside PleaseCalculate:

An empty array result = [] is created.
The arr.forEach((e) => { ... }) loop starts, iterating over each element e in arr.
For each element e, callback(e) is called, which invokes the anonymous function (n) => { return n + 2;}.

The result of callback(e) is pushed into the result array.
After iterating through the array, the result array holds the modified values ([3, 4, 5, 6, 7]).

The second forEach loop logs each value from the result array, and then "end" is printed.

Once PleaseCalculate is done executing, the anonymous function reference is no longer needed and will 
be garbage collected.

Summary of How the Anonymous Function Works:
Anonymous Function Creation: The anonymous function (n) => n + 2 is created inline when the function 
call is made.
Memory Allocation: This function is temporarily stored in memory as a function object.
Passed as Callback: The anonymous function is passed as the callback argument into PleaseCalculate.
Execution: Each time callback(e) is invoked, the anonymous function is called, performing n + 2 for
each element in the array.
Garbage Collection: Once PleaseCalculate is done executing, the anonymous function is no longer 
referenced, and the JavaScript engine eventually clears it from memory.
Benefits of Using Anonymous Functions:
Convenience: You can write a function without having to define it separately. This is useful for one-off
 operations like callbacks.
No Need for Naming: If you don't plan on reusing the function elsewhere, there’s no need to give it a
 name.
Clarity: Sometimes it can make code more readable by placing the logic directly where it’s needed 
(like inside the function call).
Final Thoughts:
Anonymous functions (especially when passed as callbacks) are fundamental to JavaScript, particularly 
for things like event handling, asynchronous operations, and higher-order functions 
(like .map(), .forEach(), .filter()).
